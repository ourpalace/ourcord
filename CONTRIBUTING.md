# Contributing
You are here to help on OurCord? Epic, feel welcome and read the following sections to know how to start contributing and make this the most awesome Discord library!



## Some FAQ Things

----
- Why should I read your guidelines?
  - Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.
---- 

- What do you want me to contribute?
  - Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or improving ~~our bad code~~ are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.
---- 

- What contributions you **DON'T** want?
  - Please don't use the issue tracker for any support-related questions, instead ~~raid~~ join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/3yDQKDXXdk "Discord Invite- Our Palce") for support or consider using Stack Overflow.

## Ground Rules
_This section will set expectations for behavior for everyone_

* Each pull request should implement **ONE** feature or bugfix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the numbrt of comments of the pull request.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (`.gitignore``).
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
* Be willing to accept criticism and work on improving your code.

## Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to OurCord? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

* Beginner issues (Issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two).
* Help wanted issues (Issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues).

Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about using OurCord or developing tutorials for OurCord bots, the OurCord documentation is free and available online. You can find the source to the documentation [here](https://ourcord.js.org "OurCord Documentation").
