# Contributing
You are here to help on OurCord? Epic, feel welcome, and read the following sections to know how to start contributing and make this the most awesome Discord library!


## Some FAQ Things

----

- Why should I read your guidelines?
  - Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open-source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

---- 



- What do you want me to contribute?
  - Keep an open mind! Improving documentation, bug triaging, or improving ~~our bad code~~ are all examples of helpful contributions that mean less work for you.

---- 


- What contributions you __DON'T__ want?
  - Please don't use the issue tracker for any support-related questions, instead, ~~raid~~ join our Discord[^discord] for support or consider using Stack Overflow.
----

- Do we have to use [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.dev/ "Gitmoji") for our commits and PRs?
  - It's not necessary but recommended.

## Ground Rules
> _This section will set expectations for behavior for everyone_

* Each pull request should implement __ONE__ feature or bug fix. If you want to add or fix more than one thing, submit more than one pull request.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the number of comments of the pull request.
* Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bug fix (`.gitignore`).
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
* Be willing to accept criticism and work on improving your code.


## Your First Contribution
Unsure where to begin contributing to OurCord? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:


* Beginner issues (Issues that should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two).
* Help wanted issues (Issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues).


While not perfect, a number of comments are a reasonable proxy for the impact a given change will have.

If you want to read about using OurCord or developing tutorials for OurCord bots, the OurCord documentation is free and available online. You can find the source to the documentation [here](https://ourcord.js.org "OurCord Documentation").

If you're still stuck here are a couple of tutorials: 

* [Make a Pull Request](http://makeapullrequest.com/ "Make a Pull Request") 
* [First Timers Only](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/ "First Timers Only")
* [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github "How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub")


_At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help, everyone is a beginner at first :D._

> __NOTE:__ If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.


## Getting started
> _This section is a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution._

For something that is bigger than a one or two-line fix:
1. [Create a fork](https://help.github.com/forking/) of `ourcord/ourcord`.
2. Edit your changes in your fork (`<your_username>/ourcord`).
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
  * Be really really really sure your code follows our [code style](#code-style)
  * After that you can now send a pull request and join the contributor gang B).


> __NOTE:__ Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch.
